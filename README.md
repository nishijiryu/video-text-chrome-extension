## Why This Extension?

Unlike cloud-based services with time limits and privacy risks, this extension runs entirely on your machine.

-   **Local File Transcription**: Upload a local audio or video file directly from the Side Panel and transcribe it with the same local backend.

-   🔒 **Privacy First**: All data stays on your `localhost`. No audio is ever uploaded to the cloud.
-   ♾️ **Unlimited**: No monthly limits, no file size limits. Transcribe 5-hour lectures or podcasts for free.
-   🎬 **Login Support**: download & transcribe high-quality videos (1080p+) from sites like Bilibili by reusing your browser cookies.
-   🚀 **Powerful Native Backend**: Uses a local Python service (FastAPI + yt-dlp + faster-whisper) to bypass browser limitations.

## Installation (For Users)

### Option A: One-Click Installer (macOS & Windows)
*(Recommended for most users)*

**macOS**:
Copy and paste this command into your Terminal:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kangchainx/video-text-chrome-extension/main/native-host/install_mac.sh)"
```
(Or download `install_mac.sh` from [Latest Release](https://github.com/kangchainx/video-text-chrome-extension/releases/latest) and run it)

**Windows**:
1. Download `install_win.ps1` from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/kangchainx/video-text-chrome-extension/releases/latest).
2. Right-click the file and select **"Run with PowerShell"**.

These scripts will automatically:
1. Download the latest Native Host release.
2. Install it to your user directory.
3. Register the Native Host manifest with Chrome/Edge.

### Option B: Manual Setup (For Developers)

If you prefer to run the Python service from source or are developing the extension.

#### 1. Extension Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Load 'dist' directory in chrome://extensions
```

The local build uses a fixed Chrome extension ID:

```text
ccdkjblfcffhfjaofhmfenkemkdapfnp
```

This ID is derived from the `key` field in `manifest.json` and is also stored in `.github/EXTENSION_ID`. Keep these values in sync with the Native Host `allowed_origins` entry.

#### 2. Local Service Setup

**Pre-requisites**: Python 3.10+, Node.js (for YouTube verification)

If you want to build the packaged Native Host locally and install that package on your own machine for testing, use the release-style flow below:

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install full packaging dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt pyinstaller

# 3. Ensure the latest yt-dlp is bundled for the local package
pip install -U yt-dlp

# 4. Build the macOS Native Host package locally
./native-host/build-macos-zip.sh <YOUR_EXTENSION_ID> <VERSION>
# Example: ./native-host/build-macos-zip.sh abcdefghijklmnopabcdefghijklmnop 1.0.6

# 5. Install the locally built package
cd native-host
chmod +x install_mac.sh
./install_mac.sh
```

Notes:
- `build-macos-zip.sh` outputs `native-host/video-text-host-macos.zip`.
- `build-macos-zip.sh` also upgrades `yt-dlp` before packaging, matching the release workflow.
- `install_mac.sh` will use that local ZIP first if it exists in the current directory, so it will not download from GitHub.
- After installation, reload the extension in `chrome://extensions` before retesting.

For Windows local builds, update the installed Native Host files and register Chrome/Edge with:

```powershell
.\native-host\update_local_win.ps1 -SourceDir .\native-host\dist
```

Use `-ExtensionId <CURRENT_EXTENSION_ID>` when testing an already installed unpacked extension with a different ID. Without this argument, the script reads `.github/EXTENSION_ID` and registers the fixed local build ID.

If you prefer to run the Python service directly from source during development, use the source-mode flow below:

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-mini.txt

# 3. Setup Native Host (macOS)
chmod +x native-host/install-macos.sh
./native-host/install-macos.sh <YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>
# You can find the ID in chrome://extensions
```

#### 3. Run Service
For development, you can run the service manually to see logs:
```bash
python mini_transcriber.py
```
*Port*: `8001` (Default)

## Architecture

This project uses a hybrid architecture to combine the convenience of a browser extension with the power of native code.

-   **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite (Chrome Side Panel)
-   **Backend**: Python (FastAPI) + SQLite
-   **Core Engines**:
    -   `yt-dlp`: For robust video/audio downloading.
    -   `faster-whisper`: For high-performance local AI transcription.
-   **Bridge**: Chrome Native Messaging (connects extension to local Python process).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Native host has exited" / Extension Can't Connect to Service

**Symptom**: Extension shows connection error or "Native host not installed" even after installation.

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Local Service Paths (macOS / Windows)**

   If you need to verify where the native host and Python service were installed:

   **macOS**
   - Install dir: `~/Library/Application Support/VideoTextHost`
   - Python service (packaged): `~/Library/Application Support/VideoTextHost/video-text-transcriber/video-text-transcriber`
   - Native host launcher: `~/Library/Application Support/VideoTextHost/host-macos.sh`
   - Source manifest: `~/Library/Application Support/VideoTextHost/manifest.json`
   - Chrome manifest: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.video_text.transcriber.json`
   - Edge manifest: `~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft Edge/NativeMessagingHosts/com.video_text.transcriber.json`

   **Windows**
   - Native Messaging manifest is stored in the registry, not a JSON file under Chrome's profile.
   - Install dir: `%APPDATA%\VideoTextHost`
   - Python service (packaged): `%APPDATA%\VideoTextHost\video-text-transcriber.exe`
   - Native host launcher: `%APPDATA%\VideoTextHost\host-win.bat`
   - Source manifest: `%APPDATA%\VideoTextHost\manifest.json`
   - Chrome registry key: `HKCU\Software\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\com.video_text.transcriber`
   - Edge registry key: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Edge\NativeMessagingHosts\com.video_text.transcriber`

2. **Extension ID Mismatch** (Most Common)

   Local development builds are pinned to `ccdkjblfcffhfjaofhmfenkemkdapfnp`. If Chrome shows a different ID for an already installed unpacked build, re-register the Native Host with that active ID or reinstall the extension from a build that includes the fixed `manifest.json` key.

   There are **two** manifest.json files involved:
   - **Source file**: `~/Library/Application Support/VideoTextHost/manifest.json` (macOS)
     - Generated by the installer with the correct extension ID
     - Used as a template but NOT read by Chrome

   - **Chrome's active file**: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.video_text.transcriber.json`
     - This is what Chrome actually reads
     - Copied from the source file during installation

   **The Problem**: If you updated the extension or reinstalled with a different ID, the source file gets updated but Chrome's file might still have the old ID.

   **Solution**:
   ```bash
   # macOS: Verify extension IDs match
   cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/VideoTextHost/manifest.json
   cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.video_text.transcriber.json

   # If they differ, copy the correct one:
   cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/VideoTextHost/manifest.json \
      ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.video_text.transcriber.json

   # Then reload your extension in chrome://extensions
   ```

2. **Script Not Executable**
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/Library/Application\ Support/VideoTextHost/host-macos.sh
   ```

3. **Incorrect Path in Manifest**

   Verify the `path` field in Chrome's manifest points to the correct location:
   ```bash
   cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.video_text.transcriber.json
   ```

#### Permission Denied

Run `chmod +x` on all scripts in `native-host/` directory.

#### Download Error (403 / 401)

-   **YouTube**: Usually works without cookies using mobile client spoofing.
-   **Bilibili 1080p**: Requires cookies. The extension needs permission to read cookies for `.bilibili.com`.
-   Check `temp/service.log` for detailed error messages.

#### First Transcription is Slow / Model Not Found

-   First run downloads ~150MB Whisper model to cache (`~/.cache/whisper` or `~/.cache/faster-whisper`)
-   Subsequent transcriptions will be much faster
-   Set `WHISPER_MODEL_DIR` environment variable to use custom cache location

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Cloud Transcription Service**: Optional server-side processing for faster transcription and higher model quality (may involve fees).
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Support for transcribing multiple videos at once.
- [ ] **Custom Model Selection**: Allow users to choose between different Whisper model sizes (base/small/medium).

## Privacy & Data Protection

🔒 **Your privacy matters**. This extension:
- ✅ Processes all data **locally** on your machine
- ✅ **Never uploads** video content or transcripts to any cloud server
- ✅ Only uses cookies to access high-quality videos you're already authorized to view
